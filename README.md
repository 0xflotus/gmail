# GMail for Python

A Pythonic interface to Google's GMail, with all the tools you'll need. Search, 
read and send multipart emails, archive, mark as read/unread, delete emails, 
and manage labels.

Heavily inspired by Kriss "nu7hatch" Kowalik's GMail for Ruby library (https://github.com/charlierguo/gmail)
